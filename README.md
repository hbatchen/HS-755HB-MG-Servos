# HS-755HB-MG-Servos

Slightly different to standard model servos due to extended rotation range.

1) Controlling with buttons / joystic switch
   The ground is disconnected (via mosfet) in software when no button pressed.
   Also the signal pins are written low because the servos ticked 
   a bit with just ground disconnected.

2) Controlling with pots / joystic pots 

I'll upload more details later
